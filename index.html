        <h1>FAHES: A Robust Disguised Missing Values Detector</h1>

        <p>Missing values are common in real-world data and may seriously affect data analytics such as simple statistics and hypothesis testing. Generally speaking, there are two types of missing values: explicitly missing values (i.e. NULL values), and implicitly missing values (a.k.a. disguised missing values (DMVs)) such as "11111111" for a phone number and "Some college" for education. While detecting explicitly missing values is trivial, detecting DMVs is not; the essential challenge is the lack of standardization about how DMVs are generated.</p>

        <p>FAHES is a system for detecting DMVs from two angles: DMVs as detectable outliers and as detectable inliers. For DMVs as outliers, we propose a syntactic outlier detection module for categorical data, and a density-based outlier detection module for numerical values. For DMVs as inliers, we propose a method that detects DMVs which follow either missing-completely-at-random or missing-at-random models.</p>

        <h2>Why do I need FAHES: </h2>
        <p>Detecting DMVs is hard, since they can be either human (carefully) faked values, or system generated values. Obviously, there is no <i>global representation</i> for DMVs. Different persons and organizations will use different representations for DMVs. Consequently, it is impossible to define general rules for all data sets. DMVs in one table could represent legitimate values in other tables. In real applications, practitioners may have to write many customized rules to detect DMVs per table, which is a daunting task.</p>

        <h2>Detectable DMVs are: </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Out of range data values, e.g. disguise the missing values in an attribute that takes only positive values with a negative value.</li> 
          <li> Outliers, e.g. disguise the missing values with a very large value or a very small value such as replacing the missing age values with the value 1000.</li>
          <li>Strings with repeated characters or characters that are next to each other on the used keyboard, e.g. replacing a phone number with 5555555555.</li> 
          <li>Values with non-conforming data types, e.g. disguising the missing strings with numerical values and vice versa.</li>
          <li> Valid values that are randomly distributed within the range of the data and used frequently in the data set.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>FAHES has three main modules: </h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Syntactic outlier detection module</b> to capture those DMVs that are syntactic outliers or contain special patterns such as strings with repeated substrings (e.g. abcabcabc) and numbers with incrementally increasing/decreasing digits (e.g. 1234567)</li>
          <li><b>Numerical outlier detection module</b> that best suits FAHES. This module detects DMVs that are far from the rest of the values in the Euclidean space</li>
          <li><b> DMVs as MCAR/MAR detector:</b> for detecting DMVs as inliers, we devise an algorithm for detecting DMVs that follow missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) or missing-at-random (MAR) models</li>
        </ul>
